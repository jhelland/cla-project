gradient descent vs. stochastic gradient descent

TODO (roughly in order):
- Port to Caffe or Torch?
- Find a good convolutional neural network example
  - LeNet 300-100
  - HMAX
- Optimization methods
  - update BFGS method to work with different linear system solving methods
  - implement L-BFGS
  - momentum based methods?
- recurrent neural network? (probably not)
  - implement
  - test gradient vs. stochastic gradient descent
