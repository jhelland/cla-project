gradient descent vs. stochastic gradient descent

TODO (roughly in order):
- nonlinear least squares
  - test gradient descent with nonlinear least squares problems
  - QR and/or SVD
  - Gauss-Newton algorithm
  - Levenbergâ€“Marquardt algorithm
- implement radial basis function neural network
  - classification/regression problem
  - train network via unsuperivised->supervised methods
  - train via gradient descent
  - train via stochastic gradient descent
