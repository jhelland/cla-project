gradient descent vs. stochastic gradient descent

TODO (roughly in order):
- nonlinear least squares
  - check Gauss-Newton algorithm for bugs (investigate strange pseudo-convergence behavior)
  - find regression problems that are interesting
- recurrent neural network
  - implement
  - test gradient vs. stochastic gradient descent
